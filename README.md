# TestingSQLCompliance

The purpose of this project is to test the SQL Compliance of the current Database Managnment Systems (DBMSs). Database Management System (DBMS) is widely used for various kinds of applications such as web applications, banking systems and critical systems. As a consequence, it is conducted a lot of research around this field regarding different aspects of DBMS such as query optimization, security and consistency. In addition, there are many different implementations of a relational database system (RDBMS) such as  PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle Database and MySQL and so forth. It is worth mentioning that these systems are designed and implemented by different people and as a result, they have slightly different characteristics. Nevertheless, in principle, all they should follow and support the SQL standard and most important, the benefit of having such a standard is that different companies can implement a completely different system in terms of internal implementation that support a common global language which is used to retrieve data from these systems. Moreover the SQL standard guarantee that identical SQL queries should retrieve the same answers independently of which DBMS are executed. SQL code is not completely portable for migrating between different DBMS even though there is such a standard.
