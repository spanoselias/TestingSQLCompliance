The aim of this project is to build a complete framework that can be used to compare and test the current DBMSs ( PostgreSQL, MySQL, IBM DB2, MS Server sql, Oracle Database). 
The core component of the framework is the random SQL generator engine that tests the aforementioned DBMSs by generating thousands of random queries 
and evaluate each query on all of them in order to identify any differences.
Our project is implemented in Java Programming Language. This framework will be useful for not only checking existing DBMSs but most importantly, to check new DBMSs. 


Compilation & Run instructions

```javascript
 Compile: javac SQLEngine.java
 Run: java SQLEngine
```

DBMSs to be checked:

```javascript
 > MySql
 > Oracle
 > PostgreSQL
 > IBM DB2
 > MSSQL Server
```

## Requirements

```javascript
> Linux or Windows
> Java 8 Update 92 or higher 
  
  ```
## Goals

The goals of this implementation are:

* Random Query Generator Engine

* Comparing SQL results engine


##Dependencies


## Progress of the project
Currently the generator creates simple sql query
