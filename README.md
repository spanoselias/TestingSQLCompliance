The aim of this project is to build a complete framework that can be used to compare and test current DBMSs ( PostgreSQL, MySQL, IBM DB2, MS Server sql, Oracle's DB). 
The core component of the framework will be the random SQL generator engine  that can test all the aforementioned DBMSs by generating thousands of  random queries 
and evaluate each query all on DBMSs in order to identify in the DBMSs are follow the SQL standard in the same manner.
Our project will be implemented using Java Programming Language. This tool will be useful for not only checking existing DBMSs but most importantly, to check any DBMSs. 


Compilation & Run instructions

```javascript
 Compile: javac SQLEngine.java
 Run: java SQLEngine
```

DBMSs to be checked:

 >- MySql
 >- Oracle
 >- PostgreSQL
 >- IBM DB2
 >- MSSQL Server

## Requirements

* Linux or Windows
* Java 8 Update 92 or higher (8u92+)
  
## Goals

The goals of this implementation are:

* Random Query Generator Engine

* Comparing SQL results engine


##Dependencies


## Progress of the project
Currently the generator creates simple sql query
