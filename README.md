The aim of this project is to build a random generator query engine that will be used to generate thousands of queries in order to 
be evaluated in the below Database Management Systems (DBMSs). Our project will be implemented using Java Programming Language. This tool will be useful for not only checking existing DBMSs but most importantly, to check any DBMSs. Currently, we will check only the below DBMSs. 


 **DBMSs to be checked:**

 >- MySql
 >- Oracle
 >- PostgreSQL
 >- IBM DB2
 >- MSSQL Server
  
  
## Goals

The goals of this implementation are:

* Random Query Generator

* Compare Result Engine
